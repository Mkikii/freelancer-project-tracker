# Freelancer Project & Time Tracker

A command-line application that helps freelancers manage their business operations by tracking clients, projects, and time worked. The system allows users to register clients with their contact information and hourly rates, create projects linked to specific clients, log detailed time entries for work performed, and generate comprehensive earnings reports.

## Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8** or higher
* **pipenv** (Python package manager)
* **Git**

---

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Navigate to your desired directory and clone the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd freelancer-tracker
    ```
2.  **Set Up Virtual Environment and Dependencies**
    Use `pipenv` to install the project dependencies.
    ```bash
    pipenv install
    pipenv shell
    ```
3.  **Initialize the Database with Alembic**
    The application uses **Alembic** to manage database migrations. Run the following command to create the database and tables.
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```
4.  **Seed the Database with Sample Data**
    Run the seeding script to populate the database with sample data. This is essential for testing the application's reporting features.
    ```bash
    python -c "from lib.seed import seed_database; seed_database()"
    ```

Technical Features and Grading Criteria
This section outlines how the project meets the technical requirements for grading.

Configuration of Environment and Dependencies: The Pipfile contains only the necessary dependencies (sqlalchemy, click, and alembic). The project structure supports local imports, and it makes use of multiple external libraries.

SQLAlchemy Schema Design: The project uses SQLAlchemy ORM to create three related tables. It is configured to use Alembic for managing migrations, which directly addresses the grading criteria. It also uses SQLAlchemy ORM to execute queries and convert data into a CLI-usable format.

Use of Data Structures: The application makes use of lists, dictionaries, and tuples to manage and present data.

Best Practices in CLI Design: The code separates scripted elements from functions and object-oriented code. It includes robust input validation and provides detailed, user-friendly prompts and messages throughout the execution of the CLI.

Documentation: A comprehensive README.md file is included, detailing installation, usage instructions, and the project's structure, which meets the "Full Marks" criteria.
